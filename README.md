# Midway Subread pipeline

These scripts process RNA-seq data using the [Subread][] pipeline. The
scripts are designed to be used with the [Slurm scheduler][slurm] on
the [RCC Midway2][midway] cluster at the University of Chicago, but
can be adapted to other computing infrastructure.

## Setup

1. Install the R/Bioconductor packages [biomaRt][] and [Rsubread][]:

    ```r
    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite(c("biomaRt", "Rsubread"))
    ```

2. Clone this repository with `git clone` or download and unzip this
[zip file][master].

## Pipeline

The scripts should be submitted in the following order. Always run
them from the head node in the root of the project directory.

1. Download and index the genome with `download-genome.R`:

    ```bash
    sbatch --mem=12G --partition=broadwl download-genome.R
    ```

2. Download and format the exons with `download-exons.R`:

    ```bash
    sbatch --mem=2G --partition=broadwl download-exons.R
    ```

3. Submit mapping jobs with `submit-subread.sh`, which calls
`run-subread.R` for each fastq file:

    ```bash
    bash submit-subread.sh
    ```

4. Submit counting jobs with `submit-subread.sh`, which calls
`run-featurecounts.R` for each BAM file:

    ```bash
    bash submit-subread.sh
    ```

## Directory structure

These scripts expect the following directory structure. Only `fastq/`
has to be created manually. The scripts will create `bam/`, `counts/`,
and `genome/`.

```
.
├── bam
├── counts
├── fastq
│   ├── YG-172S-S8-8_S125_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
│   └── YG-172S-S8-9_S126_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz
└─── genome
```

* `fastq/` - Contains raw data in `fastq.gz` files.

* `bam/` - Contains the mapped reads in BAM files.

* `counts/` - Contains the read counts in text files.

* `genome/` - Contains the index genome and the exons coordinates in
  SAF format.
